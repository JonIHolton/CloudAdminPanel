# Common Makefile Target Errors

## Error: externally-managed-environment

When you encounter the error message "error: externally-managed-environment" while running the `make tf-validate` target, it indicates that there is an issue with your Python environment. This error message typically occurs for one of the following reasons:

1. **No Virtual Environment Created**: You might not have created a virtual environment using the `make venv` command before attempting to run `make tf-validate`. A virtual environment is essential to isolate your Python packages and dependencies.

2. **Insufficient Permissions**: You may not have the necessary permissions to execute the `make tf-validate` target or to create a virtual environment.

### Solutions:

#### 1. Create a Virtual Environment:

Before running the `make tf-validate` target, make sure to create a virtual environment using the following command:

```bash
make venv
```
This command will set up an isolated environment for your project, ensuring that your Python packages do not interfere with system-wide packages.
